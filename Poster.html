                <h2>Legislative Branch</h2>
                <p>Congress (House & Senate) - Makes Laws</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Checks Executive: Can override presidential veto with 2/3 vote; impeach and remove president; approve appointments and treaties. Why: To prevent executive overreach and ensure laws align with public will.</li>
                    <li>Checks Judicial: Can impeach judges; propose constitutional amendments. Why: To maintain accountability and adapt the Constitution as needed.</li>

                <p>President & Agencies - Enforces Laws</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Checks Legislative: Can veto bills passed by Congress. Why: To block potentially harmful or unconstitutional legislation.</li>
                    <li>Checks Judicial: Appoints federal judges, including Supreme Court justices. Why: To influence the judiciary's composition over time.</li>

                <h2>Judicial Branch</h2>
                <p>Supreme Court & Courts - Interprets Laws</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Checks Legislative: Can declare laws unconstitutional via judicial review. Why: To ensure laws comply with the Constitution.</li>
                    <li>Checks Executive: Can rule executive actions unconstitutional. Why: To prevent abuse of power by the president or agencies.</li>

            <p>Checks and balances are a fundamental principle in the US Constitution designed to prevent any one branch of government from becoming too powerful. Each branch has specific powers that allow it to limit the actions of the others, ensuring a balance of authority. For example, in a real scenario like the Watergate scandal, Congress impeached President Nixon, demonstrating legislative checks on executive misconduct. In a fictional case, if a president tried to unilaterally declare war, Congress could withhold funding, illustrating the system's safeguards. This framework promotes accountability, protects individual rights, and maintains democratic governance.</p>
